# OTP_Verification_with_Python

## PROBLEM STATEMENT :
The objective of the project is to create a secure and reliable OTP (One-Time Password) verification system in Python. This system aims to enhance security by providing a temporary, one-time password for user verification. The system generates a 6-digit OTP and sends it to the user's email address. Upon receiving the OTP, the user enters it into the system for validation. If the entered OTP matches the generated OTP, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied. This project ensures a secure method of authentication, bolstering the security of user accounts and sensitive information.

## PROJECT REQUIREMENT :
Implement a function to generate a 6-digit OTP randomly.
Develop a function to simulate sending the OTP to the user's email address.
Create a function to prompt the user to enter the OTP received in their email.
Implement a function to verify if the entered OTP matches the generated OTP.
Ensure proper error handling and user-friendly prompts throughout the system.
Allow the user to retry OTP entry in case of incorrect input.

## PROJECT DELIVERABLES :
Python script containing the implementation of the OTP verification system.
Documentation explaining the functionality of each function, how to run the program, and any dependencies required.
Test cases to ensure the system functions correctly under various scenarios, including correct and incorrect OTP entries.
Optionally, you can create a simple GUI interface for the OTP verification system to enhance user experience.

## TOOLS :
Google Colab,Jupyter Notebook.
